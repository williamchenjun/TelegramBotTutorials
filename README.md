## **<p style="color:#fdb9dc">What is this about?</p>**

If you know some Python, and have thought about creating a Telegram bot, you're in the right place. It can be complicated to get started, especially if you're a self-didact or are still a beginner. Hopefully you can find my tutorials useful. I will try to keep it as simple as I can and avoiding using jargon too often.

First of all, we need to know what a "bot" is and how it works.

> A bot is an **automated system** that one can create and manipulate as they like. This can go from very simple tasks, such as repeating words, solving equations or drawing graphs, to group and database management, managing businesses and selling products.

The way Telegram bots work is through an API. The term "API" stands for "Application Programming Interface". If the acronym is not explicit enough for you, it basically means that we are given an programmable interface to manipulate whatever the application is about. In our case, it gives you the necessary "tools" to manipulate a Telegram bot however you want (with some limitations).
